## Overview

Handwritten Character Recognition is the ability of computers to interpret human handwritten characters. In this project, we develop a CNN model to recognize English alphabets from images. CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to process pixel data efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "A-Z Handwritten Alphabets" dataset, which contains 372,450 images of alphabets, each sized 28x28 pixels. The dataset is available in CSV format, where each row represents an image. You can download the dataset from Kaggle:

- [A-Z Handwritten Alphabets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (latest version)
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended IDE)

Python libraries:

- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-character-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-character-recognition
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python keras tensorflow matplotlib pandas
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**

   - Download the dataset from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format).
   - Place the `A_Z Handwritten Data.csv` file in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Load and preprocess the data:**

   - Read the CSV file using Pandas.
   - Split the data into features (`X`) and labels (`y`).
   - Reshape the features to 28x28 pixel images.
   - Normalize the pixel values.

3. **Build the CNN model:**

   - Define the model architecture using Keras.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

4. **Train the model:**

   - Fit the model on the training data.
   - Monitor the training and validation accuracy/loss.

5. **Evaluate the model:**

   - Test the model on unseen data.
   - Calculate accuracy and other relevant metrics.

6. **Make predictions:**

   - Use the trained model to predict characters from new images.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense (fully connected) layers. Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting. The architecture is designed to effectively capture the features of handwritten characters for accurate recognition.

## Training

The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, with a portion of the data reserved for validation. Training involves adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss function, thereby improving its accuracy in recognizing handwritten characters.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capability. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

## Prediction

The trained model can be used to predict the character in new, unseen images. By inputting a 28x28 pixel image into the model, it outputs the predicted alphabet with a certain confidence level.
